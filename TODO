# Things To Do Still

* Fix the linter from spamming me all the time with random crap

* Implement a compute node, with the following properties;

  2. We should identify and tag this audio, using many different strategies
  if we can. We should pick the ones with best confidence.

  3. Stream these results back to the main gateway server and store them
  somewhere for download later on. A GUID for the app instance maybe?

  4. We need a rate limiter to make sure we don't exceed our API calls
  of 3 per second... that means we can serve

  BONUS:
    4. Detect album files with heuristics and allow the user to split them out

  A local AcoustID server will be needed with Musicbrainz as a fallback
  for when we can't detect things... the Musicbrainz will do for initial
  testing, though... we'll just have to rate limit them...

  That means an album would take a few seconds.


Need a proper logging solution as well... instead of this console.log
non-sense...

Also, learn how to debug properly...
